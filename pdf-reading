personal experiences with PDF reading

HP Touchpad, webOS:

- Adobe reader displays nicely, but changing pages is a lot harder than it should be.

Nook, Kindle 3:

- pdf's don't really work well.  Might work better if they automatically shrink margins, 
but even then...

OLPC:

- might be good, if i ever get around to fixing one. ;)

Laser Printer ( ;) )

- Works very nicely, but can add to clutter.
